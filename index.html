	<h3>Hi! This is a temporary playground for projects I'm working on.</h3>
	<p>Right now I'm working on a project around creators and audience building.</p>
	<p>Audience/follower/community building is a problem central to the work of all creators. The current iteration of the project is a tool meant to help creators stick to a plan of committing to growing their community</p>
